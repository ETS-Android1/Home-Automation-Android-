Home-Automation-Android-
========================
This is an android app that allows you to automate the appliances in a room.

Download the project as a zip.

Remove the arduino file from the zip and import the rest into Eclipse.

The arduino script simply checks for a decimal number. On the basis of that, it will turn the corresponding port high/low.

Example : On receiving the number 1, the board gives port number 13 high - bedroom light on 

and on receiving the number 2, the board gives port number 13 low- bedroom light off.

You will need to change the numbers that the app throws to the bluetooth module that connects the board to the phone.

Otherthan that, upload the script to the arduino board. The current app has 4 icons in which 2 are only mapped.

If you want the other 2 switches to be functional, simply map the numbers and port numbers to turn on and off the various applications in a room.

This is free to distribute, modify and for personal use.
