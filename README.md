Home-Automation-Android-
========================
This is an android app for room automation. 
Simply extract the zip and import it into Eclipse.
This is implemented with the arduino uno board.
What i've done is thrown decimal values and corresponding to each decimal value a different component will trigger.
I'll upload the arduino script if needed, but its basically an if-condition to check the received number and corresponding light will turn on.
